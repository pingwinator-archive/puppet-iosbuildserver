# #### Overview:
#
# Define resource to retrieve files to staging directories. It is
# intententionally not replacing files, as these intend to be large binaries
# that are versioned.
#
# #### Notes:
#
#   If you specify a different staging location, please manage the file
#   resource as necessary.
